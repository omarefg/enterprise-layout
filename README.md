# Enterprise Layout

## Description

Frontend project for Platzi Master

## Getting started

First you'll have to install some dependencies

``npm i``

## Init

Then you're ready to run the project

``npm start``

## Testing

For testing run the following command.

``npm test``

This will run the project on port 9876 and open Cypress interface

## Technical information

### Languages

- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- CSS
- HTML

### Technologies

- Web Components

### Dependencies

Right now the project do use module type scripts which means that it only runs on a server. If you use VSCode I recommend [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

## Design information

### CSS Methodology

- BEM

### Mock

![mock](./assets/mock.png)

### Dimensions

- Width: 662px
- Height: 827px

### Dependencies

The project is written to fit the mock dimensions, in bigger dimensions it will fit but lose some relations. For a more equal look I recommend to run it at the same dimensions.
